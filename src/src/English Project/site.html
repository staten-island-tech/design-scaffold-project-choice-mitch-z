        <p> So you messed up and overestimated your social/education abilities or maybe Fairfield just is not the place for you. Now you are looking to transfer but before you do you need to live out a semester or even a whole school year. Luckily for you, you're not the only person who wants to transfer. In fact about one third of students transfer at least once in college. What can a student like you do to make the most of your time at Fairfield? 
        </p>
        <p>Like most colleges, Fairfield offers a lot of opportunities to its students so its your job to take any opportunities that you see helpful for yourself. In this quick tour for transfer students, I have listed 3 locations that I think are incredibly important to first year students who want to transfer. These locations will help you spend your time doing something meaningful and preventing the eventual crawl of boredom, desperation or disappointment in your decision.
        </p>
    <div>
        <p>The first location is the Kelley Center, the administration building of the university, a place where one can go to not only help with transferring, but also ask general questions. The second location will be the Dolan School of Business which provides incredible value to those who may not even be enrolled in the business programs. The third location will be the RecPlex, which unlike the other 2 locations, this one will serve as more of a social space for you.
