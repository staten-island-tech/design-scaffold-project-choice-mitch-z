        <p>The Aloysius P. Kelley Center is the administrative center of the university. Inside the building you can find multiple offices such as the registrar and bursar, but the most important one would be the Career Planning center. The reasoning behind this is that the best way to make your short time at fairfield worth it, is by investing into yourself, specifically your career and future.
            The Career Planning center can help with alot of that as it hosts a variety of career events, workshops and fairs. In addition it serves as a connection method for current students, alumni and employers.
        </p>
        <p>Building connections and figuring out a potential future career path is critical to really understanding what you may want to get out of college.
            In addition to the career planning center, you will find other offices and aministrative spaces that can help you with all the things you need when transfering schools.
