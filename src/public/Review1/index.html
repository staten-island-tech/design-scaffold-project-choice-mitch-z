        <h1>
            Dawn FM Album Review
        </h1>
    </header>
    <p>After a 2 year hiatus, The Weeknd (Abel Makkonen Tesfaye) finally returned with a continuation to his previous work, After Hours. Dawn FM is 51 minutes and  49-second long album containing a total of 16 songs, 3 of which are an intro, interlude, and closing statement. Styled in terms of a car radio hosted by Jim Carrey, the album tells the story of transitioning from life to death, disguising the “line” to death as a traffic jam on a highway.  If you were expecting anything similar to his earlier, darker mixtapes you're going to be either severely disappointed or extremely ecstatic. From start to finish Dawn FM is an incredibly upbeat, 80’s synth-pop romp fest. The songs are full of life and dip heavily into the pop synths of the late 1970s. 
        This review will go over each song individually and provide a rating from 1-10 based on my personal experience when listening to the music. It will include things I love about each song, and occasionally things I don't as well as some explanations on some deeper meanings presented in the songs.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Dawn FM-
    </h2>
    <p>Following the namesake of the album, this first track is an introduction to the dark world presented by Abel and introduces the listener to “103.5 Dawn FM” a radio station hosted by Jim Carrey. Overall this isn't anything particularly special and therefore only gets a 5/10 rating.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Gasoline-
    </h2>
    <p>
        The second track of the album features an extremely catchy hook that has become an instant favorite on the album. The usage of synths makes this track very “funky” and easy to imagine in a disco. Overall this is a solid “first” song of the album and helps set the tone for what the rest of the album will sound like. 8/10.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How do I make you love me-
    </h2>
    <p>This is a touching track that has Abel seeking approval of a love interest. It explores an interesting dynamic by referencing past songs and albums on which Abel built his reputation. He expresses surprise at the fact that he is seeking approval despite his fame.  Furthermore, Abel built a reputation of saying outrageous lyrics about sex, drugs, and party lifestyle without caring about what anyone thinks, so it comes as a surprise that he wants approval from someone. Once again a very catchy song featuring heavy synths, it scores a solid 7/10.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Take My Breath-
    </h2>
    <p>Take my breath was the leading single for this album and was very well received. In this track, Abel continues to talk about his love interest which is now referenced as death as in his previous discography, Abel constantly flirts with it. In this track, the hook sound very Michael Jackson ESC however this is where the good ends for me. The track was released on the album with an extended version which took too long to start up and left it sounding very repetitive therefore I am rating it a 5/10.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Sacrifice-
    </h2>
    <p>This track shows the opposite from Abel’s previous work, After Hours. He is now ok with accepting that he is on his own, and the lyrics tell how he doesn’t want to sacrifice his own personality to please a girl. The catchy synths continue throughout the track and set a quicker pace, almost making the song seem to pass by too quickly. 7/10
    </p>
    <h2>
        A Tale By Quincy-
    </h2>
    <p>Quincy’s tale is parallel to Abel’s life. Quincy wasn’t raised with enough love and didn’t know how to raise his own kids with love. This is a metaphor for how Abel was never truly loved by any girl in his younger years, as his relationships in his older works such as Trilogy were plagued with cheating. This affects him now as he doesn’t know how to treat his current relationship right. This is a fitting interlude for the album, but just like the intro, it isn’t really deserving of a higher rating than 5/10.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Out of time-
    </h2>
    <p>Out of time features slower synths and a little bit of percussion which compared to sacrifice sets a way slower pace to the song. This song screams the vibes of a 70s high school slow dance and induces heavy nostalgia as well as an impending sense of dread of what's to come, hence the name Out of Time, whatever that could mean to the listener. The Track ends with another segment by Jim Carrey where he talks about not touching the dial, which refers to the speed of life, or just a radio dial, depending on how deep you think about it. 8/10
    </p>
    <h2>
        Here We Go Again (featuring Tyler The Creator)-
    </h2>
    <p>This is another slower track with lots of references to The Weeknd’s past achievements such as his Superbowl halftime show. The Tyler verse however takes a different approach and talks about marriage and how he doesn’t trust himself to maintain that love throughout life, hence the constant repetition of “ you gon sign this prenup”, the prenup being protection for both people in the marriage. In all honesty, this isn’t too enjoyable of a song for me therefore it only gets a 6/10.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Best Friends-
    </h2>
    <p>Another track about toxic love, Best Friends tells the story of how the Weeknd has offered to become best friends with a girl after mentioning that “pain and regret are her best friends now.” While the girl has caught feelings, Abel doesn't trust himself to keep the relationship.7/10 
    </p>
    <h2>
        Is There Someone Else-
    </h2>
    <p>Continuing the trend of toxic love, Abel doesn't hesitate in this track to get straight to the point. He talks about sensing that his lover isn’t happy and isn't afraid to ask what's wrong. He states that he doesn’t want to be part of a love triangle and doesn't want to “share” his love. A very catchy hook created by an amazing sample combined with the deeper lyrics about love in this track has made it one of my personal favorites. 8/10
    </p>
    <h2>
        Starry Eyes-
    </h2>
    <p>Another track with references to past albums (Kissland and After Hours) and past periods of Abel’s life show the more vulnerable side of Abel. Once again through the mention of a lover, he sees himself through her where he implies that they are bonded by the pain both have experienced in the past. A melancholic track that tears up the listener, it gets a solid 7/10.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Every Angel is Terrifying-
    </h2>
    <p>This interlude starts off with a direct quote from Rainer Maria Rilke’s first Duino Elegies poem, a series of poems composed originally in German between 1912 and 1923 at Duino Castle on the Italian coast. The poems juxtapose intense, overwhelming religious beauty with existential cosmic horror. The interlude then transitions into what seems to be a commercial one would usually hear on the car radio. Abel believes the idea of an afterlife to be a fantasy that is advertised by religion and sold to society. This is clear as the idea of an afterlife being proposed as a radio advert and made to look compelling. Despite only being an interlude, I personally love the radio commercial, therefore, earning it a 7/10.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Don’t Break my Heart-
    </h2>
    <p>Going back to the concept of love, this track talks about the influence Abel’s new girl has on him.  This new relationship is an addiction for him, hence the consistent mention of ecstasy. The insanely catchy hook shows how Abel doesn’t want to be disappointed again because that might be the end for him. Despite the dark lyrics, the song is insanely catchy through its use of synths and the aforementioned hook. This is also one of my favorites from the album and earns itself a 9/10.
    </p>
    <h2>
        I Heard Your Married (featuring Lil Wayne)-
    </h2>
    <p> Honestly the lyrics in this song convey the same meaning as the rest of the songs on the album. That being said, they are still very good on the ears. The Lil Wayne verse offers a nice change of pace for the song and actually gives a very “funky” vibe. Once again, another solid song. 7/10
    </p>
    <h2>
        Less Than Zero-
    </h2>
    <p>An emotional heartfelt song that almost serves as an apology to the world. The Weeknd combines all the messages and emotions from previous songs into one. He talks about his dark truth, being that despite all his effort to change, he cant. He tries to hide this feeling but would rather be freed from his self-imposed “purgatory”. If there was any song to listen to on this album, it would be this. A bit of warning though, the song could produce some tears, whether you connect to the lyrics or just like the sound. This is my favorite song on the Album and therefore gets a 10/10.
     </p>
    <h2>
        Phantom Regret By Jim-
    </h2>
    <p>The perfect outro to an album of deeper meaning. Religiously infused, this slow speech of acceptance by Jim Carrey serves as the end, the light at the end of the tunnel. By the end of the song, the listener could be purified and cleansed, and reach a fuller realization of what heaven is. The outro flows really well with Less Than Zero and also earns itself a 10/10.
